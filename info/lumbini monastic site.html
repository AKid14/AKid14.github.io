      <h1>About Lumbini Monastic Site</h1>
      <p>
        The Lumbini Monastic Site is a sacred complex dedicated to preserving the spiritual and historical significance of Lord Buddha's birthplace. This expansive area is part of the larger Lumbini Development Zone, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Site features an array of monasteries, meditation centers, and monuments, as well as numerous meditation centers where visitors can engage in mindfulness practices and retreats.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lumbini Monastic Site is designed to accommodate pilgrims and visitors, offering them a place for meditation, study, and reflection. The site is divided into two zones: the East Monastic Zone, dedicated to Theravada Buddhism, and the West Monastic Zone, which primarily features Mahayana and Vajrayana monasteries. The Monastic Site is adjacent to the Sacred Garden, which contains the Maya Devi Temple, the Ashoka Pillar, and the sacred Bodhi tree.

      <img src="../images/East Monastic Zone.jpg" alt="Lumbini Background" class="lumbini-bg-img" />
      <p>
        The East Monastic Zone has monasteries where Theravada Buddhism is specifically practised. This zone has The Royal Thai Monastery, Cambodian Temple, International Gautami Nun's Temple, the Myanmar Golden Temple, Sri Lankan Monastery, Dhamma Janani Vipassana Monastery, Nepal Theravada Buddha Vihar Mahabodhi Society of India and the Canadian Engaged Buddhism Association. Theravada Buddhism is followed devotedly in regions like Thailand, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Burma and Laos. It is, therefore, also called Southern Buddhism.
